## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Tab Management**: The extension detects and manages exactly two YouTube Music tabs.
2. **Playback Monitoring**: It monitors the current song's progress in the active tab.
3. **Crossfade Trigger**: When the song nears its end (based on your settings), the extension:
   - Starts the next tab at 0% volume
   - Fades out the current tab while fading in the next
   - Pauses and advances the old tab after the crossfade
4. **Role Reversal**: The process repeats, always keeping your music flowing.

All controls and logic are handled via robust content scripts and a background service worker, ensuring reliability even as YouTube Music's interface evolves.
